"""Arm-only dynamics data collection for the tracked-vehicle manipulator.

The reach-mode data collector from ``docs/arm-dyn-model.md`` (sections 5-7) and
the second NeDM dynamics study case, parallel to the HMMWV pipeline in
``hmmwv_data.py``. It drives the 4-DOF gripper arm through smooth random
free-space motions while the tracked base is held fixed, and records joint-space
transitions

    x_t = [q_t, qdot_t, qcmd_t]   a_t = Δqcmd_t   ->   x_{t+1} = [q_{t+1}, ...]

so a learned arm dynamics model ``f_arm`` can be trained on free-space motion.

The scene -- M113 tracked vehicle + front-welded ``LRV_Arm`` + flat rigid terrain
-- is built here (ported from lunar-manip's ``TrackedVeh_Builder``). The gripper
arm model and its SolidWorks export/meshes are bundled under ``src/arm_model``.

Four pieces beyond a plain assemble-and-drive scene:

1. **Arm collision geometry.** Only the gripper fingers ship with collision
   shapes; the links do not. We fit one box collision shape per link from the
   link's (already scaled) visual-mesh AABB, in the body reference frame.

2. **Collision detection (arm-vs-track, arm self-collision, arm-vs-ground).**
   Each arm link gets its OWN collision family, whose mask allows colliding with
   the M113 track-shoe family (6) *and* the families of all NON-ADJACENT arm
   links; chain neighbours (which share a joint and legitimately touch) and the
   road wheels / sprocket / idler / chassis are excluded. So a nonzero
   ``body.GetContactForce()`` on a link means it touched a track shoe or folded
   into a non-adjacent link. The flat ground is handled separately and exactly:
   a link hits the ground when its collision-box lowest point reaches the terrain
   plane (z=0), a geometric test that needs no contact identity (pychrono's
   contact callback is broken here) and no force-timing luck. All three are
   termination signals; the self/track label is heuristic (which links report
   force at once), ground is exact.

3. **Compliant PD actuation.** ``LRV_Arm`` drives its joints with
   ``ChLinkMotorRotationAngle``, a *hard angle constraint* -> ``q == qcmd``
   exactly, i.e. no dynamics to learn. The plan instead wants "a low-level PD
   controller in Chrono drives the physical joints toward qcmd" (doc 5.1), so we
   swap the four angle motors for ``ChLinkMotorRotationTorque`` + a per-substep
   PD loop. Now ``q`` lags ``qcmd`` under gravity/inertia and the transitions
   carry real dynamics.

4. **Episode / termination logic + logging.** Every episode starts from a fresh
   Chrono scene at the imported home configuration, then follows smooth random
   ``qcmd`` targets (doc 6.3). One CSV row per control step holds a full
   transition; episodes truncate at ``--max-steps`` or terminate the moment a
   link contacts a track, self-collides, hits the ground, or leaves the configured
   joint range. The terminal row is flagged ``collision=1`` so training keeps it
   out of the free-space set and routes it to safety-filter debugging.

Run in the NeDM conda env:

    conda run -n nedm python -m nedm.arm_data --episodes 4 --max-steps 500

Add ``--render`` to watch one run in the Irrlicht viewer.

NOTE on scope: this collects Chrono ground-truth data and uses Chrono's own
collision detection for termination. The lightweight geometric *safety filter*
used during learned-model RL rollouts (doc 7.2-7.4) is a separate component and
is intentionally not implemented here.
